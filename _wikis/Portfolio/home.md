# Portfolio for James Menzies

## Target Audience

Given my background as a professional musician, I have a rare opportunity to corner an area of the market that most programmers don't. This namely being musicians who are in need of a developer, but also require someone who has a knowledge of the nuances and jargon of the musical profession as well.

Whilst the intention is to optimize my website towards this demographic, I am mindful to make sure that it caters towards all potential employers as well.

## Purpose of Website

There are four core purposes of this website:
1. I want to make it as efficient as possible for employers to find my credentials and contact details.
2. I want to showcase my work in a more interactive way than is possible with a standard Github repository. I also want to cater to those that might feel apprehensive about visiting Github as well.
3. I want to demonstrate my capabilities through the working integrity of the website.
4. I want to showcase my life as a professional musician. The aim is to create a unique impression for those who aren't from my background, and to affirm my integrity to those that are.
