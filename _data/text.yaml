biography: 
  - James began learning the double bass from the age of 10. He woudl then graduate from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music with a Bachelor of Music Performance in 2010. Over the course of his studies, he learnt primarily from Alex Henery (Principal, Sydney Symphony) and Maxime Bibeau (Principal, Australian Chamber Orchestra). He was also fortunate enough to participate in elite training ensembles such as the Australian Youth Orchestra (2007-08) and the Sydney Sinfonia (2008-2013).
  - Since graduating, James worked as as a teacher and freelancer working with numerous orchestras such as the Sydney Symphony, West Australian Symphony Orchestra, Auckland Philharmonia, Canberra Symphony, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, and the Opera Australia Orchestra. In 2014, he won a contract with the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, which became a permanent position in 2015. 
  - James has experienced many highlights since joining the TSO, but most notably among them were tours to China and Melbourne, as well as winning being part of a Helpman winning performance of Tristan and Isolde in 2017. He has also taken a keen interest in the running of the orchestra, joining the Musician's Representative committee in 2020.
  - Since joining the TSO, James began taking a keen interest in coding, where he began learning Java in order to make side projects as a hobby. However in 2020, with the pandemic taking full effect, he decided to enrol in Coder Academy's Cloud, Code and Cybersecurity bootcamp. He is due to graduate in early 2021.

blog_intro: 
  - I like to document as many moments as I can, as there is likely a need to reflect on them from time to time. Hopefully within is a solution you've been searching for. If you find something helpful, or would like me to investigate something, let me know!

media_intro:
  - Here you will find various photos and videos of me taken throughout my career as a double bass player. Most of these are taken from rehearsals and performances with my orchestra the TSO. If you're a local artist based in Hobart and want to do something together, please get in touch. I'd love to hear from you.

  - If there's something you'd like me to write for you, get in touch now!

sales_pitch:
  - The nature of the musical profession is nuanced and complex, making it inherently difficult to write software for. That's where I come in. With over 20 years of instrumental experience and 10 years in the classical music industry I am rarely placed to cater to any industry related software needs. Get in touch today, and we can start discovering the solution you're after.

welcome_tag:
  - I'm James, I'm a musician and coder. There's plenty to do here. Take a look around.
