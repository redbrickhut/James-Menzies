<p>A simple control that I wrote to allow a user to select an object from a predefined list by inputting text. This control also uses autocomplete with camel-casing for speedy input for the end user. This control extends the TextField class, and has the additional property “selectedObject” for internal retrieval. A demo showcasing all of this is included in the repo.</p>
