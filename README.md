### Target Audience

Given my background as a professional musician, I have a rare opportunity to corner an area of the market that most programmers don't. This namely being musicians who are in need of a developer, but also require someone who has a knowledge of the nuances and jargon of the musical profession as well.\
\
Whilst the intention is to optimize my website towards this demographic, I should be mindful of making sure that it caters towards all potential employers as well.
